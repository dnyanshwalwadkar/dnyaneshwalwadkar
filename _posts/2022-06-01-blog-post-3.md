Tolerance is a virtue that is often misunderstood and misconstrued. Some individuals may view toleration as a form of weakness, believing that by tolerating a situation, they are passively giving in to it. However, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” Tolerance is not about surrendering to a situation, but rather about understanding and accepting the reality of it.

Consider the scenario of studying in a crowded, noisy, and disorganized environment. If this is the only location available for study, one may choose to tolerate the conditions. However, it is important to understand that while tolerating, if one continues to focus on feelings of powerlessness and lament the situation, they will not be able to make progress. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, “You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.”


Instead, by using tolerance as a means to focus on the purpose of studying and the importance of the studies themselves, the individual will find that their studies become increasingly absorbing, fulfilling, and productive. Ultimately, this will empower them to create a better life for themselves and those they care about.

It is crucial to note that while one may initially begin tolerating due to feelings of powerlessness, ultimately, toleration should be based on purposefulness. As Confucius said, “It does not matter how slow you go as long as you do not stop.” It is only by focusing on one’s purpose that the empowering effects of toleration can be fully realized. Indeed, successful individuals often choose their battles by tolerating certain situations while working to improve others.

The Bhagavad-gita, a sacred text, offers insight into the true nature of tolerance. In chapter 2, verse 14, the text calls for tolerance, highlighting the ultimate goal of spiritual realization and the realization of one’s indestructible identity. By understanding and accepting the reality of one’s spiritual identity, one can transcend the material world and experience boundless joy. As Mahatma Gandhi said, “The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.”

When we cultivate tolerance, we are accepting others’ right to have different beliefs and behaviors. This allows us to harmonize with the way in which God has created us all, providing us with free will. The various sacred texts of the world demonstrate that while God guides us to use our free will wisely, He does not override it. This is exemplified in the Bhagavad-gita’s conclusion, chapter 18, verse 63, where the speaker, Krishna, who is considered an incarnation of God, respects human independence and appeals to human intelligence. As Albert Einstein said, “The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don’t do anything about it.”

Humility, as taught by HH Radhanath Swami, is not about allowing others to treat us with disrespect without standing up for ourselves. Rather, it is about not allowing the actions of others to dictate our decisions and lives. It is about being able to calmly assess the cause of disrespect and take a principled course of action to address it and correct the behavior.


Humility and tolerance are crucial in protecting us from internal over-reactions to externally distasteful situations. They are the inner muscles that we can strengthen through the spiritual practice of chanting the holy names of God. As HH Radhanath Swami said, “Humility and tolerance constitute our inner muscles, which we can increase by the spiritual bodybuilding exercise of chanting the holy names of God.” These practices help us to maintain a sense of balance and equanimity in the face of adversity, allowing us to navigate life’s challenges with poise and grace.


It is important to note that tolerance does not equate to embracing philosophical relativism, which denies the possibility of objective truth in the realm of spirituality. Just because we accept that others have the right to different beliefs, it does not mean that we must accept that all of those beliefs are right. Through the teachings of one’s tradition, one may discern that different beliefs have varying degrees of alignment with truth. As George Orwell said, “The further a society drifts from truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.”

Similarly, when we tolerate various behaviors that may arise from different beliefs, it does not mean that we tolerate any and every behavior, particularly those that are intolerant. Intolerance in action, such as terrorizing,persecuting, or eradicating others, is a behavior that cannot and should not be tolerated. As Nelson Mandela said, “No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.” Tolerance that does not stand up to intolerance is ineffective.

Intolerance is a sign of an inadequate education. It stems from a lack of understanding and humility, leading to arrogant impatience and a lack of empathy for others. As we learn and grow, it is important to develop a sense of compassion for the young, the aged, the struggling, and even the weak and the wrong. We must remember that we have all been in these positions at some point in our lives. Tolerance is essential in creating a harmonious society, but it should not be limitless. We must be prepared to defend a tolerant society against those who preach intolerance and persecution. As such, we must claim the right not to tolerate the intolerant and consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal. We must strive to create a society that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds

In conclusion, tolerance is a virtue that has the potential to empower individuals in navigating challenging situations. As Mother Teresa said, “I know God won’t give me anything I can’t handle. I just wish he didn’t trust me so much.” It is not about surrendering to a situation, but rather about understanding and accepting the reality of it. By focusing on one’s purpose, the empowering effects of toleration can be fully realized. Tolerance implies accepting others’ right to have different beliefs, but it does not mean accepting that those beliefs are right or that they justify intolerant behavior.

As Martin Luther King Jr. said, “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.” Tolerance is not only about accepting others but also standing up against the wrong, it’s about making the world a better place for all.
