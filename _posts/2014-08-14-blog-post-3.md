The poem highlights the fact that our self-image, or the way we see ourselves, is often influenced by the opinions of others. We may be told that we are not good enough or that we are to blame for certain things, and these words can shape the way we view ourselves. Similarly, praise and recognition for our talents and gifts can also shape our self-image. However, the poem suggests that we should not let the opinions of others define us or determine our self-worth. Instead, we should look within ourselves and find our own sense of identity and purpose.

The poem also speaks to the idea that life is full of ups and downs, with both pleasure and pain, loss and gain. If we become too focused on one side or the other, we may be “swept away” and lose sight of our true selves. To avoid this, the poem suggests that we need to have an anchor or a spiritual foundation to hold onto. This foundation can be found through spiritual practices such as meditation and yoga, as well as through the study of wisdom texts like the Bhagavad Gita.

The poem emphasizes the importance of recognizing and embracing both our strengths and weaknesses. Rather than rejecting or repressing our feelings, the poem suggests that we should use our intelligence to discipline and moderate them. By doing this, we can better connect with our true selves and find inner peace. Through spiritual practices and the study of wisdom texts, we can raise our consciousness and find a sense of purpose and meaning in life. The poem specifically mentions the path of bhakti-yoga, with Krishna at its center, as a way to achieve this. Overall, the poem encourages individuals to find their own truth and purpose, rather than relying on external validation or the opinions of others, and to use spiritual practices and wisdom texts as a guide on this journey.

### **Poem: The Journey to Self-Discovery**

Our self-image, our conception of who we are,  
Is often shaped by others’ opinions, near and far.  
We may be told we’re not good enough, or that we’re to blame,  
But these words should not define us, or leave us in shame. || 1 ||  

We may be praised for our talents, and our gifts to share,  
But even these can falter, or be surpassed elsewhere.  
So let us not be swayed by others’ views,  
But rather look within and find our own crew. || 2 ||  

Like an ocean, life is full of waves,  
Pleasure and pain, loss and gain.  
If we’re heavily invested in just one side,  
We’ll be swept away, and our self-image will hide. || 3 ||  

But we can protect ourselves from this fate,  
By having an anchor to hold onto, and a spiritual state.  
The Bhagavad Gita gives us wisdom and insight,  
To understand our essential identity and take flight. || 4 ||  

For when we embrace our true selves with grace,  
We bring our best selves to the world, with a smile on our face.  
The Bhagavad Gita teaches us the same way,  
To find our true selves and live each day. || 5 ||  

Beyond our abilities and inabilities lies,  
Our indestructible self, a spiritual enterprise.  
A self-image based on our spiritual essence,  
Brings us strength, positivity, and purpose, with presence. || 6 ||  

So let us not ignore or discount our strengths and flaws,  
But rather use them as tools for growth and evolution’s doors.  
For our abilities and inabilities are part of who we are,  
But they should not be the sole basis for our self-image, near or far. || 7 ||  

We can’t just reject or repress our feelings,  
For they enrich our life, and our hearts and minds are healing.  
But we can discipline and moderate them with our intelligence,  
For our mind and emotions don’t have to be our whole existence. || 8 ||  

We can use our intelligence to realize our true selves,  
Above our mind and emotions, like the sky with nothing to delve.  
Our wavering emotions are just like weather, changing and shifting,  
But we are the sky, and our consciousness can lift. || 9 ||  

The key to finding our true selves lies within,  
In a sense of inner awareness and connection to our spiritual kin.  
This may involve practices such as meditation and yoga,  
That help us quiet the noise and connect with our inner aura. || 10 ||  

And with spiritual practices as a regular discipline,  
We’ll be less affected by life’s binaries, and our self-image will flourish within.  
We’ll be better situated in our true selves, with a peace that’s clear,  
And able to navigate life’s waves with strength and cheer. || 11 ||  

It enables us to stay consistently bright,  
Managing our inabilities and unleashing our might.  
So let us base our self-image not on what we can or cannot do,  
But rather on our actual identity, and the path we pursue. || 12 ||  

So let us not let others’ opinions rule our lives,  
But rather find our own truth and purpose that thrives.  
Not reliant on external validation or achievement’s nod,  
But rather rooted in our true selves, and the path we trod. || 13 ||  

Our mind is fickle by nature, it’s true,  
It gets attracted to shiny objects, old and new.  
If we let it catch our attention, without a doubt,  
We’ll waste our time, or even bring ourselves to rout. || 14 ||  

But we can break this cycle, and find some peace,  
By strengthening our intelligence, and finding inner release.  
Through study of wisdom texts and contemplation deep,  
We can go beyond extreme reactions and find the great path to keep. || 15 ||  

So let us not be swayed by every shiny or dark other’s opinion in our sight,  
But rather focus on the things that matter, and let our intelligence take flight.  
For when we master our mind and focus on our true goals,  
We can live a life of purpose, with peace in our souls. || 16 ||  

Let us use our intelligence to commit to spiritual practices,  
That can raise our consciousness above our mind and all its crises.  
The Bhagavad Gita offers many paths, but bhakti-yoga is supreme,  
With Krishna at its center, and a life of purpose and meaning to redeem. || 17 ||
