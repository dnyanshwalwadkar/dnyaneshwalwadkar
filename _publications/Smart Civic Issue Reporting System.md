excerpt: 'Reporting road and citizen issues was no longer an easy process for citizens. Reporting problems such as road damage, street cleaning, dents, trash can overflows, street lightpost damage, or anything under the supervision of a municipality requires lengthy steps and procedures. There is still no guarantee that this is the case. Reported complaints will be processed by the competent authority. If daily 1000 complaints get registered then Because of this, most complaints are unheard, unanswered, and unresolved because the company is too large to handle small complaints from one person. To facilitate this grievance, we will implement an Smart Android application that citizens can use to report infrastructure issues in their city to relevant authorities. Therefore, whenever people encounter urban infrastructure, transportation, environmental cleanliness, or disruptions in their daily lives, they can share, discuss, and resolve issues with relevant authorities through this online Android portal. Complaints are registered via the mobile application. A hybrid CNN-RNN image processing algorithm & using the SVM-NLP model detects the severity of registered problems, so based on that higher severe issues get addressed first. The GPS (Global Positioning System) sensor on smart mobile devices can pinpoint the exact location of the problem zone and use the camera to record the problem area as visual evidence. The system then generates a form containing all the data and location and visual evidence entered by the user and sends it to a central server. The central server notifies the relevant agencies.'
