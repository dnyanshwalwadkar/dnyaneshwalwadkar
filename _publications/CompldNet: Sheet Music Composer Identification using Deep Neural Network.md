excerpt: 'There have been significant breakthroughs in computer vision research in many subfields, including composer identification from images of sheet music. Previous work in composer identification depends on a specific digital semantic representation of music and various evaluation criteria, making it difficult to quantify their relative merits. We present a novel approach using an end-to-end deep neural network model for music composer identification with images of sheet music as inputs. Hence, this method is not dependent on the conversion of the sheet music to any other intermediate digital semantic format. Additionally, we compare results from classification applied to sheet music and the respective bootleg representation. Identifying the composer can lead to more inferred data, which is helpful in archiving historical pieces digitally. Based on our experimental results, it can be concluded that the composer identification in sheet music images with deep neural models shows promising results. With the proposed model, we achieved 83% accuracy for composer identification on sheet music images compared to 76% accuracy when applied to the bootleg representations on our newly collected dataset..'
