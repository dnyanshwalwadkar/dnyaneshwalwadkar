### Abstract
Advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have underscored the need for datasets that support underrepresented languages, particularly in specialized areas like mathematical reasoning. Despite Hindi being spoken by over 600 million people, resources for training language models to handle mathematical and logical tasks in Hindi remain scarce. To address this, we introduce **HindiMathQuest**, a large-scale dataset designed to improve the performance of language models in mathematical problem-solving tasks expressed in Hindi.

### Key Features of HindiMathQuest
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes mathematical concepts, Hindi numerals, terminology, geometric terms, physics-related operations, and equations, ensuring a robust representation of mathematical reasoning in Hindi.
- **Dual-Format Dataset**:
  - **Pure Hindi Section**: Contains 13.1 million tokens and 64,658 sentences.
  - **Mixed-Language Section**: Combines English text with Hindi numerical values expressed in words, containing 89.7 million tokens and 249,603 sentences.
- **Topic Span**: Logical reasoning, arithmetic, geometry, competitive exam-style problems, and translation-based numerical questions.
- **Expert Verification**: Over 30% of the dataset has been manually verified for accuracy, focusing on the challenges of the Hindi numeral system and mathematical syntax.
  
### Contributions and Results
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: The Gemma-2B model was fine-tuned using HindiMathQuest, resulting in significant accuracy improvements in interpreting Hindi mathematical questions during human-verified testing.
- **Applications**: This dataset serves as a crucial resource for developing robust Hindi language models capable of addressing mathematical and scientific reasoning tasks, with applications in education and practical problem-solving.
- **Democratizing AI**: By enhancing the generalization of mathematical reasoning across languages, HindiMathQuest contributes to the broader goal of democratizing AI for low-resource languages.

### Dataset Details
- **Token and Sentence Count**:
  - **Pure Hindi Section**: 13.1M tokens, 64,658 sentences.
  - **Mixed-Language Section**: 89.7M tokens, 249,603 sentences.
- **Unique Features**: Incorporates Hindi words, numerals, and mixed-language representation to accommodate diverse linguistic expressions.
